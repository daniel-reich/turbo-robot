"""


Create a function that takes a string (without spaces) and a word list,
cleaves the string into words based on the list, and returns the correctly
spaced version of the string (a sentence). If a section of the string is
encountered that can't be found on the word list, return `"Cleaving stalled:
Word not found"`.

### Examples

    word_list = ["about", "be", "hell", "if", "is", "it", "me", "other", "outer", "people", "the", "to", "up", "where"]
    cleave("ifitistobeitisuptome", word_list) ➞ "if it is to be it is up to me"
    
    cleave("hellisotherpeople", word_list) ➞ "hell is other people"
    
    cleave("hellisotterpeople", word_list) ➞ "Cleaving stalled: Word not found"

### Notes

Words on the `word_list` can appear more than once in the string. The
`word_list` is a reference guide, kind of like a dictionary that lists which
words are allowed.

    for w in l:
      if s[:len(w)]==w:r,s,f=r+' '+w,s[len(w):],0
    if f:return'Cleaving stalled: Word not found'
  return r[1:]
