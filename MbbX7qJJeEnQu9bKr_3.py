"""


Given a string `text`. Write a function that returns the character with the
highest frequency. If more than 1 character has the same highest frequency,
return all those characters as an array sorted in ascending order. If there is
no repetition in characters, return `"No Repetition"`.

### Examples

    max_occur("Computer Science") ➞ ['e']
    
    max_occur("Edabit") ➞ "No Repetition"
    
    max_occur("system admin") ➞ ['m', 's']
    
    max_occur("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") ➞ [' ']

### Notes

Try to make use of the concept used in counting sort.

"""

from collections import Counter as C
def max_occur(text):
  d=dict(C(text))
  m=max(d.values())
  res=[x for x in d if d[x]==m]
  return sorted(res) if m!=1 else "No Repetition"
