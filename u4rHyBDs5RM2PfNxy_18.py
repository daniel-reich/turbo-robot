"""


Create a function that counts the number of blocks of **two or more** adjacent
`1`s in a list.

### Examples

    count_ones([1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ 2
    # Two instances: [1, 1] (middle) and [1, 1, 1] (end)
    
    count_ones([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]) ➞ 0
    
    count_ones([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) ➞ 1
    
    count_ones([0, 0, 0]) ➞ 0

### Notes

  * A single 1 by itself (surrounded by a zero on its left and right), does **not** count towards the total (see first example).
  * Each input will contain only zeroes and ones.

"""

def count_ones(lst):
    result = '0'+''.join([str(i) for i in lst])
    a = result.count('110')
    b = result.count('011')
    return max(a,b)
