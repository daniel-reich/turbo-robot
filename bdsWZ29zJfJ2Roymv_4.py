"""


Write a function that swaps the first **pair** (1st and 2nd characters) with
the second **pair** (3rd and 4th characters) for every quadruplet substring.

### Examples

    swap_two("ABCDEFGH") ➞ "CDABGHEF"
    
    swap_two("AABBCCDDEEFF") ➞ "BBAADDCCFFEE"
    
    swap_two("munchkins") ➞ "ncmuinhks"
    
    swap_two("FFGGHHI") ➞ "GGFFHHI"

### Notes

Keep **leftover strings** in the same order.

import re
​
def swap_two(txt):
  return re.sub(r'(\w{2})(\w{2})', r'\2\1', txt)
