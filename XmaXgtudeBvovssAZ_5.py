This problem went viral in China, spreading on Weibo. The problem is to solve
for the area shown in red between the semicircle and the rectangle’s diagonal.

Create a function that takes a number `r` as an the length of the side and
returns the area rounded to the nearest thousandth.

### Examples

    redArea(0) ➞ 0
    
    redArea(4) ➞ 1.252
    
    redArea(25) ➞ 48.906

### Notes

The input `r` is always a valid number.

"""

from math import atan, sin, pi
def red_area(r):
    d = pi / 2 - 2 * atan(0.5)
    return round(r * r * ((1 + sin(d)) / 2 - d) / 2, 3)
