"""


You have received an encrypted message from space. Your task is to decrypt the
message with the following simple rules:

  * Message string will consist of capital letters, numbers, and brackets only.
  * When there's a block of code inside the brackets, such as `[10AB]`, it means you need to repeat the letters **AB** for **10 times**.
  * Message can be embedded in multiple layers of blocks.
  * Final decrypted message will only consist of capital letters.

Create a function that takes encrypted message `txt` and returns the decrypted
message.

### Examples

    space_message("ABCD") ➞ "ABCD"
    
    space_message("AB[3CD]") ➞ "ABCDCDCD"
    # "AB" = "AB"
    # "[3CD]" = "CDCDCD"
    
    space_message("IF[2E]LG[5O]D") ➞ "IFEELGOOOOOD"
