"""


Create a function that takes a list of more than three numbers and returns the
**Least Common Multiple** (LCM).

### Examples

    lcm_of_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) ➞ 2520
    
    lcm_of_list([13, 6, 17, 18, 19, 20, 37]) ➞ 27965340
    
    lcm_of_list([44, 64, 12, 17, 65]) ➞ 2333760

### Notes

The LCM of a list of numbers is the smallest positive number that is divisible
by each of the numbers in the list.

"""

def lcm_of_list(numbers):
  n = 1
  for i in numbers:
    n = (n*i)//gcd(n,i)
  return n
​
def gcd(a,b): 
  if(b==0): 
    return a 
  else: 
    return gcd(b,a%b)
