"""


In mathematics, primorial, denoted by “#”, is a function from natural numbers
to natural numbers similar to the factorial function, but rather than
successively multiplying positive integers, the function only multiplies
**prime numbers**.

Create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns its **primorial**.

### Examples

    primorial(1) ➞ 2
    # First prime number = 2
    
    primorial(2) ➞ 6
    # Product of first two prime numbers = 2*3 = 6
    
    primorial(6) ➞ 30030

### Notes

n >= 1.

     return reduce(lambda a,b:a*b,p[:n])
