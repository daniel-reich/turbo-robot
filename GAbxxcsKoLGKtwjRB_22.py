"""


Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the **sum** of all
**prime numbers** in the list.

### Examples

    sum_primes([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) ➞ 17
    
    sum_primes([2, 3, 4, 11, 20, 50, 71]) ➞ 87
    
    sum_primes([]) ➞ None

### Notes

  * Given numbers won't exceed 101.
  * A prime number is a number which has exactly two divisors.

"""

primes = [i for i in range(2, 102) if all([i % j != 0 for j in range(2,i)])]
​
def sum_primes(lst):
  return sum([i for i in lst if i in primes]) or None
