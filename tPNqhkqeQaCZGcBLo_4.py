And who cursed the most in the fight between you and your spouse?

Given a **dict** with three rounds, with nested **dict** s as your score per
round, return who cursed the most based on the following:

  * If you, return "ME!"
  * If your spouse, return "SPOUSE!"
  * If a draw, return "DRAW!"

### Examples

    determine_who_cursed_the_most({
      "round1": { "me": 10, "spouse": 5 },
      "round2": { "me": 5, "spouse": 10 },
      "round3": { "me": 10, "spouse": 10 }}) ➞ "DRAW!"
