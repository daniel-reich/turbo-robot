"""


Given three lists (daily sales of product A, daily sales of product B, daily
sales targets), return a string representing a _stacked column chart_ of the
total sales (with targets) for each day of the week.

  * All sales are rounded to the nearest 10 units.
  * Each column uses "+" for product A, "*" for product B, and an underscore ("_") for the target line.
  * The y-axis shows the total sales (the maximum combined sales will be 80).
  * The x-axis shows the first two letters of each day of the week (Monday to Sunday).
  * Product A sales are stacked on top of product B sales.
  * Target underscores sit on the row above their actual value (see notes).
  * Daily sales will never be greater than the target.
  * All columns have a width of two characters.
  * A single column of "|" is used to border the left and right-hand sides of the chart.
  * All elements of the chart (x-axis, columns, borders) are seperate by a blank column one space wide.
  * Use the newline character ("\n") to separate each line in the chart.

### Example

    column_chart([30, 20, 10, 30, 10, 20, 10], [20, 10, 10, 10, 20, 0, 10], [50, 40, 20, 40, 30, 30, 40]))
    âžž "60 | __                   |\n50 | ** __    __       __ |\n40 | **       ** __ __    |\n30 | ++ ** __ ++ **       |\n20 | ++ ++ ** ++ ** ++ ** |\n10 | ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ |\n   | Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su |"
    
    By day:
    
                Mo  Tu  We  Th  Fr  Sa  Su
    productA = [30, 20, 10, 30, 10, 20, 10]
    productB = [20, 10, 10, 10, 20,  0, 10]
    target   = [50, 40, 20, 40, 30, 30, 40]
    
    When printed:
    
    60 | __                   |
    50 | ** __    __       __ |
    40 | **       ** __ __    |
    30 | ++ ** __ ++ **       |
    20 | ++ ++ ** ++ ** ++ ** |
    10 | ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ |
       | Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su |

### Notes

Be careful when placing the target underscores. Although the Monday target is
50 in the example above, the underscore is placed on the row where sales equal
60).
