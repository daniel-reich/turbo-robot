A snail goes up the stairs. Every step, he must go up the step, then go across
to the next step. He wants to reach the top of the tower.

Write a function that returns the distance the snail must travel to the top of
the tower given the height and length of each step and the height of the
tower.

### Examples

    total_distance(0.2, 0.4, 100.0) ➞ 300.0
    # Total distance is 300.
    
    total_distance(0.3, 0.2, 25.0) ➞ 41.7
    
    total_distance(0.1, 0.1, 6.0) ➞ 12.0

### Notes

  * All given values are greater than `0`.
  * Round answers to the nearest tenth `0.1`.
  * Number of steps determined by tower height divided by stair height.
  * For the purposes of this exercise, the last step's length must be counted to complete the journey.
