"""


There was supposed to be a challenge here, but the only things present are
random tests. Pass them anyways.

### Examples

    import random
    
    manipulate() == random.randrange(1000) ➞ True
    
    manipulate() == random.randrange(2024) ➞ True
    
    manipulate() == random.randrange(60049) ➞ True

### Notes

  * The challenge is passable.

"""

class Univ: __eq__ = lambda self,other: True
def manipulate(): return Univ()
