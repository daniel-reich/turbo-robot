"""


Write a function that divides a phrase into word buckets, with each bucket
containing `n` or fewer characters. Only include full words inside each
bucket.

### Examples

    split_into_buckets("she sells sea shells by the sea", 10)
    ➞ ["she sells", "sea shells", "by the sea"]
    
    split_into_buckets("the mouse jumped over the cheese", 7)
    ➞ ["the", "mouse", "jumped", "over", "the", "cheese"]
    
    split_into_buckets("fairy dust coated the air", 20)
    ➞ ["fairy dust coated", "the air"]
    
    split_into_buckets("a b c d e", 2)
    ➞ ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

### Notes

  * Spaces count as one character.
  * Trim beginning and end spaces for each word bucket (see final example).
  * If buckets are too small to hold a single word, return an empty list: `[]`
  * The final goal isn't to return just the words with a length equal (or lower) to the given `n`, but to return the entire given phrase bucketized (if possible). So, for the specific case of "by" the only word with a proper length, the phrase can't be bucketized, and the returned list has to be empty.

  if n >= len(ph):
    return B + [ph]
  if " " not in ph[:n+1]:
    return []
  k = ph[:n+1].rindex(" ")
  return split_into_buckets(ph[k+1:], n, B + [ph[:k]])
