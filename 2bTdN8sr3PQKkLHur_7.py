"""


You are given two numbers `a` and `b`. Create a function that returns the next
number greater than `a` and `b` and divisible by `b`.

### Examples

    divisible_by_b(17, 8) ➞ 24
    
    divisible_by_b(98, 3) ➞ 99
    
    divisible_by_b(14, 11) ➞ 22

### Notes

`a` will always be greater than `b`.

"""

def divisible_by_b(a, b):
  divisible = 0
  for i in range(a,a+b):
    if i > a and i > b:
      if i%b == 0:
        divisible += i
  return divisible
