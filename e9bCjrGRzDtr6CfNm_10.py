"""


Consider the equation `ax-b=bx-3a+4` where `a` and `b` are constants. Create a
function that takes numbers `a` and `b` as arguments, and returns the solution
of the equation.

  * If the equation does not have a solution, return `"No solution"`.
  * If any number satisfies the equation, return `"Any number"`.

### Examples

    solve(1, 2) ➞ -3.0
    
    solve(-4, -6) ➞ 5.0
    
    solve(4, 1) ➞ -2.333

### Notes

Round your answer to three decimal places.

"""

def solve(a, b):
  n, d = b - 3*a + 4, a - b
  if n == 0 and d == 0:
    return 'Any number'
  if d == 0: 
    return'No solution'
  return round(n / d, 3)
