"""


Given what is supposed to be typed and what is actually typed, write a
function that returns the broken key(s). The function looks like:

    find_broken_keys(correct phrase, what you actually typed)

### Examples

    find_broken_keys("happy birthday", "hawwy birthday") ➞ ["p"]
    
    find_broken_keys("starry night", "starrq light") ➞ ["y", "n"]
    
    find_broken_keys("beethoven", "affthoif5") ➞ ["b", "e", "v", "n"]

### Notes

  * Broken keys should be ordered by when they first appear in the sentence.
  * Only one broken key per letter should be listed.
  * Letters will all be in lower case.

def find_broken_keys(a,b):
  return sorted(set(v for i,v in enumerate(a) if v!=b[i]), key = a.index)
