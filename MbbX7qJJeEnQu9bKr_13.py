"""


Given a string `text`. Write a function that returns the character with the
highest frequency. If more than 1 character has the same highest frequency,
return all those characters as an array sorted in ascending order. If there is
no repetition in characters, return `"No Repetition"`.

### Examples

    max_occur("Computer Science") ➞ ['e']
    
    max_occur("Edabit") ➞ "No Repetition"
    
    max_occur("system admin") ➞ ['m', 's']
    
    max_occur("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") ➞ [' ']

### Notes

Try to make use of the concept used in counting sort.

"""

from collections import Counter
def max_occur(text):
  ct = Counter(text)
  m = max(ct.values())
  if m == 1:
    return "No Repetition"
  return [k for k,v in ct.items() if v == m]
