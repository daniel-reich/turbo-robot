"""


Write a function that swaps the first **pair** (1st and 2nd characters) with
the second **pair** (3rd and 4th characters) for every quadruplet substring.

### Examples

    swap_two("ABCDEFGH") ➞ "CDABGHEF"
    
    swap_two("AABBCCDDEEFF") ➞ "BBAADDCCFFEE"
    
    swap_two("munchkins") ➞ "ncmuinhks"
    
    swap_two("FFGGHHI") ➞ "GGFFHHI"

### Notes

Keep **leftover strings** in the same order.

"""

def swap_two(txt):
  if len(txt)<4: return txt
  r = ''
  while len(txt)>3:
    r += txt[2:4]
    r += txt[:2]
    txt = txt[4:]
  return r + txt
