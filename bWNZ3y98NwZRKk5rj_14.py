"""


Create a function that returns a number which can block the player from
reaching 3 in a row in a game of Tic Tac Toe. The number given as an argument
will correspond to a grid of Tic Tac Toe: topleft is 0, topright is 2,
bottomleft is 6, and bottomright is 8.

  * Create a function that takes two numbers `a`, `b` and returns another number.
  * This number should be the final one in a line to block the player from winning.

### Examples

    block_player(0, 3) ➞ 6
    
    block_player(0, 4) ➞ 8
    
    block_player(3, 5) ➞ 4

### Notes

The values given will always have two filled squares in a line.

"""

def block_player(a, b):
  if a // 3 == b // 3: return (a // 3) * 9 + 3 - a - b
  if a % 3 == b % 3:   return (a % 3) * 3 + 9 - a - b
  return 12 - a - b
