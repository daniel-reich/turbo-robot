"""


Create a function that returns `True` if an array of pairs are sufficient for
a clear ordering of all items.

To illustrate:

    clear_ordering([["D", "A"], ["C", "B"], ["A", "C"]]) ➞ True
    # Since unequivocally: "D" < "A" < "C" < "B"

On the other hand:

    clear_ordering([["D", "A"], ["B", "A"], ["C", "D"]]) ➞ False
    # Since we know that "C" < "D" < "A", and we know "B" < "A"
    # but we don't know anything about "B"s relationship with "C" or "D".

### Examples

    clear_ordering([["S", "T"], ["T", "U"], ["U", "V"]]) ➞ True
    
    clear_ordering([["T", "S"], ["T", "U"], ["U", "V"], ["V", "W"]]) ➞ False

### Notes

See Comments for a good visualization of the question.

"""

import itertools as i
def clear_ordering(lst):
  p = i.permutations(set(i.chain.from_iterable(lst)))
  g = iter([[x[i], x[i+1]] for i in range(len(x)-1)] for x in p)
  return any(all(pairs in lst for pairs in group) for group in g)
