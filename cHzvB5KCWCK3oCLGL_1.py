The goal of this challenge is to implement the logic used in Conway's Game of
Life. Wikipedia will give a better understanding of what it is and how it
works (check the resources tab above).

### Rules

  *  **For a space that's "populated":**
    * Each cell with 0 or 1 neighbours dies, as if by solitude.
    * Each cell with 2 or 3 neighbours survives.
    * Each cell with 4 or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  *  **For a space that's "empty" or "unpopulated":**
    * Each cell with 3 neighbours becomes populated.

### Parameters

`board`: a 2-dimensional list of values 0 to 1.

  * 0 means that the cell is empty.
  * 1 means the cell is populated.

### Return Value

A `string` containing the board's state after the game logic has been applied
once.

    On character: I
    Off character: _

### Notes

  * The string should be divided by newlines `\n` to signal the end of each row.
  * A cell's "neighbours" are the eight cells that are vertically, horizontally and diagonally adjacent to it.
