"""


The challenge is to try and fix this buggy code, given the inputs `True` and
`False`. See the examples below for the expected output.

### Examples

    has_bugs(True) ➞ "sad days"
    
    has_bugs(False) ➞ "it's a good day"

### Notes

Don't overthink this challenge (look at the syntax and correct it).

"""

def has_bugs(b):
  return 'sad days' if b else 'it\'s a good day'
