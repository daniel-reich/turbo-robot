"""


Create a function that returns the mean of all digits.

### Examples

    mean(42) ➞ 3
    
    mean(12345) ➞ 3
    
    mean(666) ➞ 6

### Notes

  * The mean of all digits is the sum of digits / how many digits there are (e.g. mean of digits in 512 is `(5+1+2)/3(number of digits) = 8/3=2`).
  * The mean will always be an integer.

def mean(num):
  dgt_lst = [int(x) for x in str(num)]
  return sum(dgt_lst)/len(dgt_lst)
