"""


 **Mubashir** needs your help to find out **number of animals** hidden in a
given string `txt`.

You are provided with an array of animals given below:

    animals = ["dog", "cat", "bat", "cock", "cow", "pig",
    "fox", "ant", "bird", "lion", "wolf", "deer", "bear",
    "frog", "hen", "mole", "duck", "goat"]

 **Rule:** Return the **maximum number** of animal names. See the below
example:

    txt = "goatcode"
    
    count_animals(txt) ➞ 2
    # First animal = "dog"
    # Remaining string = "atcoe",
    # Second animal = "cat".
    # count = 2 (correct)
    
    # If you got a "goat" first time
    # remaining string = "code",
    # no animal will be found during next time.
    # count = 1 (wrong)

### Examples

    count_animals("goatcode") ➞ 2
    # "dog", "cat"
    
    count_animals("cockdogwdufrbir") ➞ 4
    # "cow", "duck", "frog", "bird"
    
    count_animals("dogdogdogdogdog") ➞ 5
