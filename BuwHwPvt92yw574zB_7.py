"""


Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (`num`, `length`) and
returns a list of multiples of `num` until the list length reaches `length`.

### Examples

    list_of_multiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]
    
    list_of_multiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]
    
    list_of_multiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]

### Notes

Notice that `num` is also included in the returned list.

def list_of_multiples (num, length):
  return [i for i in range(num,num*length+1,num)]
