"""


Create a function that determines the minimum number of characters needed to
make a strong password.

A password is considered _strong_ if it satisfies the following criteria:

  * Its length is at least 6.
  * It contains at least one digit.
  * It contains at least one lowercase English character.
  * It contains at least one uppercase English character.
  * It contains at least one special character: `!@#$%^&*()-+`

Types of characters in a form you can paste into your solution:

    numbers = "0123456789"
    lower_case = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    upper_case = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    special_characters = "!@#$%^&*()-+"

### Examples

    strong_password(“Ed1”) ➞ 3
    
    strong_password(“#Edabit”) ➞ 1
    
    strong_password("W1llth!spass?") ➞ 0

### Notes

Try solving this without RegEx.

"""

def strong_password(password):
  p=0
  sc='!@#$%^&*()-+'
  for i in password:
    if i.isnumeric():
      p|=1
    elif i.islower():
      p|=2
    elif i.isupper():
      p|=4
    elif i in sc:
      p|=8
  return max(6-len(password),4-bin(p).count('1'))
