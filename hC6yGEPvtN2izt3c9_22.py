"""


A Sudoku is a 9x9 grid that is completed when every 3x3 square, row and column
consist of the numbers 1-9.

For this task, you will be given a completed 3x3 square, in the form of a two-
dimensional list. Create a function that checks to make sure this 3x3 square
contains each number from 1-9 exactly once. Make sure there are no duplicates,
and no numbers outside this range.

### Examples

    is_mini_sudoku([[1, 3, 2], [9, 7, 8], [4, 5, 6]]) ➞ True
    
    is_mini_sudoku([[1, 1, 3], [6, 5, 4], [8, 7, 9]]) ➞ False
    # The 1 is repeated twice
    
    is_mini_sudoku([[0, 1, 2], [6, 4, 5], [9, 8, 7]]) ➞ False
    # The 0 is included (outside range)
    
    is_mini_sudoku([[8, 9, 2], [5, 6, 1], [3, 7, 4]]) ➞ True
