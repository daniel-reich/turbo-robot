"""


A number `num`, that elevated to the power of another number `k` "ends" with
the same `num`, it's automorphic.

    5² = 25
    # It's automorphic because "25" ends with "5"
    
    5³  = 125
    # It's automorphic because "125" ends with "5"
    
    76⁴ = 33362176
    # It's automorphic because "33362176" ends with "76"

A number can have various powers that make it automorphic (i.e. look at number
`5` in the above example). In this challenge, you have to verify if the given
number is automorphic for each power from `2` up to `10`.

Given a non-negative integer `num`, implement a function that returns the
string:

  * `"Polymorphic"` if `num` is automorphic for **every** power from `2` up to `10`.
  * `"Quadrimorphic"` if `num` is automorphic for **only four** powers (any from `2` up to `10`).
  * `"Dimorphic"` if `num` is automorphic for **only two** powers (any from `2` up to `10`).
  * `"Enamorphic"` if `num` is automorphic for **only one** power (any from `2` up to `10`).
  * `"Amorphic"` if `num` is **not automorphic** for for any powers from `2` up to `10`.

### Examples

    power_morphic(5) ➞ "Polymorphic"
    # From 2 up to 10, every power of 5 ends with 5
    
    power_morphic(21) ➞ "Enamorphic"
    # 21⁶ = 85766121
    
    power_morphic(7) ➞ "Dimorphic"
    # 7⁵ = 716807
    # 7⁹ = 40353607
    
    power_morphic(4) ➞ "Quadrimorphic"
    # 4³ = 64
    # 4⁵ = 1024
    # 4⁷ = 16384
    # 4⁹ = 262144
    
    power_morphic(10) ➞ "Amorphic"
    # There are no powers that make it automorphic

### Notes

  * You can do a complete loop cycle to check if `num` is automorphic for each power, or you can try to spot the discriminants that permit you to shorten the logic of your code.
  * Despite being inspired by the OEIS sequence A003226, the assertions of this challenge are to be considered properly valid only in the specific context.
