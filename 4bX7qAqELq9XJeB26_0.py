"""


Create a function that converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel
casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the
original word was capitalized.

### Examples

    to_camel_case("A-B-C") ➞ "ABC"
    
    to_camel_case("the-stealth-warrior") ➞ "theStealthWarrior"
    
    to_camel_case("The_Stealth_Warrior") ➞ "TheStealthWarrior"

### Notes

An empty string as input `""` should return an empty string.

"""

def to_camel_case(text):
  text = text.replace('_','-')
  lst = text.split("-")
  return lst[0] + ''.join([i.capitalize() for i in lst[1:]])
