"""


Create a function that takes a mathematical expression as a string, list of
numbers on which the mathematical expression is to be calculated and return
the result as a list of string.

### Examples

    mathematical("f(y)=y+1",[1,2]) ➞ ["f(1)=2","f(2)=3"]
    
    mathematical("f(y)=y^2",[1,2,3]) ➞ ["f(1)=1","f(2)=4","f(3)=9"]
    
    mathematical("f(y)=yx3",[1,2,3]) ➞ ["f(1)=3","f(2)=6","f(3)=9"]

### Notes

  * List of numbers are positive integers.
  * In the algebraic expression x = `*`

"""

def mathematical(exp, numbers):
  _,f = exp.replace('x', '*').replace('^', '**').split('=')
  results = []
  for n in numbers:
    y = n
    results.append(eval(f))
  return ['f({})={}'.format(x,int(y)) for x,y in zip(numbers, results)]
