"""


For each challenge of this series you **do not** need to submit a function.
Instead, you need to submit a **template string** that can formatted in order
to get a certain outcome.

Write **three dictionaries** and a template string according to the following
example. Notice the article "a" in the third example:

### Example

    dic1 = {"yourkeys": "yourvalues"}
    dic2 = {"yourkeys": "yourvalues"}
    dic3 = {"yourkeys": "yourvalues"}
    template = "yourtemplatestringhere"
    
    template.format(**dic1) ➞ "I like Mary, I don't like May."
    template.format(**dic2) ➞ "I love Eda, I don't love Bit."
    template.format(**dic3) ➞ "I have a Pidgey, I don't have a Rattata."

### Tips

The elements of a dictionary can be unpacked and passed to `.format()` as
keyword arguments using a double star operator `**`:

    product = {"name": "pokeball", "price": 20}
    "One {name} is ${price:.2f}".format(**product) ➞ "One pokeball is $20.00"

### Notes

  * Submit a string, not a function.
  * Do not change the names of the variables `template`, `dic1`, `dic2` and `dic3`.
  * You can find all the exercises in this series [over here](https://edabit.com/collection/hCYFNwxGwnAYzq497).

dic2 = {"verb": "love", "name1": "Eda", "name2": "Bit"}
dic3 = {"verb": "have", "name1": "a Pidgey", "name2": "a Rattata"}
​
template = "I {verb} {name1}, I don't {verb} {name2}."
