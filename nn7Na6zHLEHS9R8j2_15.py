"""


Create a function that takes a list and returns the number of ALL elements
within it (including those within the sub-level list(s)).

### Examples

    deep_count([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 3
    
    deep_count([[1], [2], [3]]) ➞ 6
    
    deep_count(["x", "y", ["z"]]) ➞ 4
    
    deep_count(["a", "b", ["c", "d", ["e"]]]) ➞ 7

### Notes

In the examples above, notice how the sub-lists within the main list count as
an element _as well as_ the elements within that sub-list.

"""

def deep_count(lst):
  count = 0
  for i in lst:
    count = count + 1
    if isinstance(i,list):
      count = count + deep_count(i)
​
  return count
