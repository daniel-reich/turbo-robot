In this challenge, write a funcion `loneliest_number` to find the last
_Lonely_ number inside a sequence. A number is _Lonely_ if the distance from
its **closest** Prime sets a new record of the sequence.

    Sequence = from 0 to 3
    
    # Any number lower than 3 doesn't have a Prime preceeding it...
    # ...so that you'll consider only its next closest Prime.
    
    0 has distance 2 from its closest Prime (2)
    # It's a new record! 0 It's the first lonely number of the sequence
    1 has distance 1 from its closest Prime (2)
    2 has distance 1 from 3
    3 has distance 1 from 2
    
    # The sequence 0 to 3  has only one Lonely number: 0
    Sequence = Numbers from 5 to 10
    
    5 has distance 2 from its closest Prime (3 or 7)
    # It's a new record! 5 It's the first lonely number of the sequence
    6 has distance 1 from 5 or 7
    7 has distance 2 from 5
    8 has distance 1 from 7
    9 has distance 2 from 7 or 11
    10 has distance 1 from 11
    
    # The sequence 5 to 10  has only one Lonely number: 5
    Sequence = Numbers from 19 to 24
    
    19 has distance 2 from its closest Prime (17)
    # It's a new record! 19 It's the first lonely number of the sequence
    20 has distance 1 from 19
    21 has distance 2 from 5
    22 has distance 1 from 23
    23 has distance 4 from 17 or 29
    # It's a new record! 23 is the second lonely number of the sequence
    24 has distance 1 from 23
    
    # The sequence 19 to 24  has two Lonely numbers: 19 and 23

The function `loneliest_number` must accept two integers `lo` and `hi` being
the **inclusive** bounds of the sequence to analyze, and returns a dictionay
(`dict`) object with the following keys and values:

  * `number:` is the **last _Lonely_ number found** in the given sequence;
  * `distance:` is the distance of the `number` from its closest Prime;
  * `closest:` is the Prime closest to `number` (if two Primes are equally distant from `number`, return the **higher Prime** ).

### Examples

    loneliest_number(0, 22) ➞ {
      number: 0, distance: 2, closest: 2
    }
    
    loneliest_number(8, 123) ➞ {
      number: 53, distance: 6, closest: 59
    }
    
    loneliest_number(938, 1190) ➞ {
      number: 1140, distance: 11, closest: 1151
    }
    
    loneliest_number(120, 1190) ➞ {
      number: 211, distance: 12, closest: 223
    }

### Notes

  * The numbers `0`, `1` and `2` have no previous Prime to check, so that you'll consider only the next Prime to set the distance, as in Example #1.
  * Remember that you are searching for the **closest** Prime when establishing if the distance is a record: `7` has a distance equal to `2` because its closest Prime is `5`.
  * If a Lonely number is equally distant from two Primes, you have to return the higher Prime, as in Example #2 (`53` has distance `6` from either `47` and `59`).
  * The first Lonely number of a sequence is (trivially) always equal to the sequence lower bound.
  * You can expect valid non-negative integers as input, without exceptions to handle.
