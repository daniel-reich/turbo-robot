"""


The function is given a map with `1` representing land, `0` representing
water. A land cell can have four neighbors along its edges. Compute the total
perimeter of shore-lines that are defined by land cells touching water or the
outer edges of the map. Each cell edge has a length equal to `1`. An isolated
cell without neighbors has a total perimeter length of `4`.

### Examples

    islands_perimeter([
      [0, 1, 0, 0],
      [1, 1, 1, 0],
      [0, 1, 0, 0],
      [1, 1, 0, 0]
    ]) ➞ 16
    islands_perimeter([
      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
      [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
      [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
      [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    ]), 42)
    islands_perimeter([
      [1, 0]
    ]) ➞ 4
