"""


Write a function that repeats the shorter string until it is equal to the
length of the longer string.

### Examples

    lengthen("abcdefg", "ab") ➞ "abababa"
    
    lengthen("ingenius", "forest") ➞ "forestfo"
    
    lengthen("clap", "skipping") ➞ "clapclap"

### Notes

  * Both strings will differ in length.
  * Both strings will contain at least one character.
  * Either of the two strings could be the shortest in length.

def lengthen(s1, s2):
  short, long = sorted([s1, s2], key=len)
  return (short*10)[:len(long)]
