"""


You are in the process of creating a chat application and want to add an
**anonymous name** feature. This anonymous name feature will create an alias
that consists of two capitalized words beginning with the same letter as the
users first name.

Create a function that determines if the list of users is mapped to a list of
anonymous names correctly.

### Examples

    is_correct_aliases(["Adrian M.", "Harriet S.", "Mandy T."], ["Amazing Artichoke", "Hopeful Hedgehog", "Marvelous Mouse"]) ➞ True
    
    is_correct_aliases(["Rachel F.", "Pam G.", "Fred Z.", "Nancy K."], ["Reassuring Rat", "Peaceful Panda", "Fantastic Frog", "Notable Nickel"]) ➞ True
    
    is_correct_aliases(["Beth T."], ["Brandishing Mimosa"]) ➞ False
    # Both words in "Brandishing Mimosa" should begin with a "B" - "Brandishing Beaver" would do the trick.

### Notes

Both words in the alias should be capitalized.

"""

def is_correct_aliases(names, aliases):
  for idx, l in enumerate(names):
    als = aliases[idx].split(" ")
    if l[0] == als[0][0] and l[0] == als[1][0]:
      continue
    else:
      return False
  return True
