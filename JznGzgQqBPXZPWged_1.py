"""


Resistors are electrical components that add resistance to a circuit.
Resistance is measured in ohms. When resistors are connected in series, the
total resistance is merely the sum of the individual resistances:

    Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...

When resistors are connected in parallel, the reciprocal of the total
resistance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual
resistances:

    1/(Rtotal) = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...

Let's specify that series resistors be designated by enclosing them in
parentheses, and parallel resistors by enclosing them in square brackets. Now
we can calculate the equivalent resistance of the network:

  * `(2, 3, 6)` = 11 ohms
  * `[2, 3, 6]`= 1 ohm

Nesting these structures in the same way tuples and lists are nested allows us
to model complex resistor networks.

Create a function that takes a nested network as a string and returns the
equivalent resistance of the network. Round results to the nearest tenth of an
ohm.

### Examples

    resist("(10, [20, 30])") ➞ 22.0
    # 10 in series with [20, 30] in parallel.
    
    resist("[10, (20, 30)]") ➞ 8.3
    # 10 in parallel with (20, 30) in series.
    
    resist("([10, 20], (30, 40))") ➞ 76.7
    # [10, 20] in parallel in series with (30, 40) in series.
    
    resist("(1, [12, 4, (1, [10, (2, 8)])])") ➞ 3.0
    
    resist("(6, [8, (4, [8, (4, [6, (8, [6, (10, 2)])])])])") ➞ 10

### Notes

This is the schematic for the last example above:
