"""


A Fibonacci Word is a specific sequence of binary digits (or symbols from any
two-letter alphabet). The Fibonacci Word is formed by repeated concatenation
in the same way that the Fibonacci numbers are formed by repeated addition.

Create a function that takes a number `n` as an argument and returns the first
`n` elements of the Fibonacci Word sequence.

If `n < 2`, the function must return `"invalid"`.

### Examples

    fibo_word(1) ➞ "invalid"
    
    fibo_word(3) ➞ "b, a, ab"
    
    fibo_word(7) ➞ "b, a, ab, aba, abaab, abaababa, abaababaabaab"

### Notes

        for iter in range(2, n):
            lst.append(lst[iter-1]+lst[iter-2])
    return ', '.join(lst)
