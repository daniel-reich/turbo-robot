"""


A **consecutive-run** is a list of adjacent, consecutive integers. This list
can be either increasing or decreasing. Create a function that takes a list of
numbers and returns the length of the longest **consecutive-run**.

To illustrate:

    longestRun([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) ➞ 5
    # Two consecutive runs: [1, 2, 3] and [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (longest).

### Examples

    longest_run([1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 15]) ➞ 3
    # Longest consecutive-run: [1, 2, 3].
    
    longest_run([5, 4, 2, 1]) ➞ 2
    # Longest consecutive-run: [5, 4] and [2, 1].
    
    longest_run([3, 5, 7, 10, 15]) ➞ 1
    # No consecutive runs, so we return 1.

### Notes

If there aren't any consecutive runs (there is a gap between each integer),
return `1`.

from itertools import groupby
​
def longest_run(lst):
  inc = [b == a + 1 for a, b in zip(lst, lst[1:])]
  dec = [b == a - 1 for a, b in zip(lst, lst[1:])]
  return max([sum(g) for _, g in groupby(inc)] + [sum(g) for _, g in groupby(dec)]) + 1
