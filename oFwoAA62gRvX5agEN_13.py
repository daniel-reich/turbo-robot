"""


Given a knapsack with a certain weight capacity, fill it with loot from a list
of items to achieve the highest value possible.

The function takes two parameters: an integer specifying the maximum weight
the knapsack can hold, and a list of dictionary items to choose from. Each
item has a name, a weight, and a value. The total weight of all chosen items
cannot exceed the capacity of the knapsack.

The function should return a dictionary containing the capacity of the bag, a
list of items that were added to the bag (in the same order that they were
given), the total weight of those items, and the total value of the items.

### Example

    knapsack(0, items) âžž {
      "capacity": 0,
      "items": [],
      "weight": 0,
      "value": 0
    }
