"""


Create a function which counts how many lone `1`s appear in a given number.
Lone means the number doesn't appear twice or more in a row.

### Examples

    count_lone_ones(101) ➞ 2
    
    count_lone_ones(1191) ➞ 1
    
    count_lone_ones(1111) ➞ 0
    
    count_lone_ones(462) ➞ 0

### Notes

Tests will include positive whole numbers only.

from itertools import groupby
def count_lone_ones(n):
  return sum(len(list(g))==1 and i=='1' for i,g in groupby(str(n)))
