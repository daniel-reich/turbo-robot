"""


Given a predetermined rate from a dictionary, write the function that will
return the time it takes for a certain amount of people to paint a certain
amount of walls. Return the minutes as an integer. No rounding is necessary.

### Example

    // It takes 22 minutes for 10 people to paint 10 walls.
    // How many minutes does it take 14 people to paint 14 walls?
    
    let rate = {
      people: 10,
      walls: 10,
      minutes: 22
    }
    
    time(rate, people, walls) âžž 22
