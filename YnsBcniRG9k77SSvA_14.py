"""


Imagine a school that kids attend for 6 years. In each year, there are five
groups started, marked with the letters _a, b, c, d, e_. For the first year,
the groups are _1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e_ and for the last year, the groups are _6a,
6b, 6c, 6d, 6e_.

Write a function that returns the groups in the school by year (as a string),
separated with a comma and a space in the form of `"1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 2a, 2b
(....) 5d, 5e, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e"`.

### Examples

    print_all_groups() âžž "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e "

### Notes

Use nested "for" loops to achieve this, as well as the array of `["a", "b",
"c", "d", "e"]` groups.
