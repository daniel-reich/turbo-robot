"""


Given a string of letters in the English alphabet, return the letter that's
missing from the string. The missing letter will make the string be in
alphabetical order (from A to Z).

If there are no missing letters in the string, return `"No Missing Letter"`.

### Examples

    missing_letter("abdefg") ➞ "c"
    
    missing_letter("mnopqs") ➞ "r"
    
    missing_letter("tuvxyz") ➞ "w"
    
    missing_letter("ghijklmno") ➞ "No Missing Letter"

### Notes

The given string will never have more than one missing letter.

"""

def missing_letter(txt):
  ascii = [ord(x) for x in txt]
  letter = [chr(x) for x in range(min(ascii), max(ascii)) if x not in ascii]
  return "No Missing Letter" if len(letter) == 0 else letter[0]
