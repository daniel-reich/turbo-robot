"""


The golden ratio is ubiquitous in math, science, art, and nature. This
challenge is concerned with the number itself, which is 1.618033988 to 10
significant digits. Implement a function that calculates the golden ratio to
100 significant digits using only integers, strings and basic arithmetic
operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `//`

### Examples

    golden_ratio() âžž 1.618033988+90 more decimal places

### Notes

This function has no argument so naturally there is only one test case.

"""

def golden_ratio():
    a, b = 1, 1
    for k in range(10**4):
        a, b = b, a + b
    b *= 10**100
    g = b // a
    r = str(g)[0] + '.' + str(g)[1:-1]
    return r
