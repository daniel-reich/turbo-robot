"""


There is a single operator in Python, capable of providing the remainder of a
division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter
divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return
that value.

### Examples

    remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1
    
    remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3
    
    remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0
    
    remainder(7, 2) ➞ 1

### Notes

  * The tests only use positive integers.
  * Don't forget to `return` the result.
  * If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the **Resources** tab.
