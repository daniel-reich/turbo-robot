"""


Jay and Silent Bob have been given a fraction of an ounce but they only
understand grams. Convert a fraction passed as a string to grams with up to
two decimal places. An ounce weighs 28 grams.

### Examples

    jay_and_bob("half") ➞ "14 grams"
    
    jay_and_bob("quarter") ➞ "7 grams"
    
    jay_and_bob("eighth") ➞ "3.5 grams"

### Notes

Add the string "grams" to the end with a space.

def jay_and_bob(s):
  return '{} grams'.format(14 if s == 'half' else 7 if s == 'quarter' else 3.5 if s == 'eighth' else 1.75)
