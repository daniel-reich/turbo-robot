"""


Create a function that converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel
casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the
original word was capitalized.

### Examples

    to_camel_case("A-B-C") ➞ "ABC"
    
    to_camel_case("the-stealth-warrior") ➞ "theStealthWarrior"
    
    to_camel_case("The_Stealth_Warrior") ➞ "TheStealthWarrior"

### Notes

An empty string as input `""` should return an empty string.

"""

def to_camel_case(txt):
    if '-' in txt:
        s = '-'
    else:
        s = '_'
    low = txt.split(s)
    return ''.join([low[i] if i==0 else low[i].capitalize() for i in range(len(low))])
