"""


Create a function that takes a two-dimensional list as an argument and returns
a one-dimensional list with the values of the original 2d list that are
arranged by spiralling through it (starting from the top-left).

### Examples

    spiral_transposition([
      [7, 2],
      [5, 0]
    ])
    
    ➞ [7, 2, 0, 5]
    
    spiral_transposition([
      [1, 2, 3],  
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ])
    
    ➞ [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
    
    spiral_transposition([
      [1, 1, 1],  
      [4, 5, 2],
      [3, 3, 2] 
    ])
    
    ➞ [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]

### Notes

If you do not understand the instructions, write the 3x3 list example on a
piece of paper and trace the output through it.

    return list(zip(*lst))[::-1]

    lst2 = []
    while lst:
        lst2 += lst.pop(0)
        lst = transpose(lst)
    return lst2
