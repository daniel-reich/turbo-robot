"""


This is a **reverse coding challenge**. Normally you're given explicit
directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own
function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produce the
sample outputs shown.

### Examples

    "A4B5C2" ➞ "AAAABBBBBCC"
    
    "C2F1E5" ➞ "CCFEEEEE"
    
    "T4S2V2" ➞ "TTTTSSVV"
    
    "A1B2C3D4" ➞ "ABBCCCDDDD"
