"""


An identity matrix is defined as a square matrix with **1s** running from the
top left of the square to the bottom right. The rest are **0s**. The identity
matrix has applications ranging from machine learning to the general theory of
relativity.

Create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the identity matrix of
`n x n` dimensions. For this challenge, if the integer is negative, return the
mirror image of the identity matrix of `n x n` dimensions.. It does not matter
if the mirror image is left-right or top-bottom.

### Examples

    id_mtrx(2) ➞ [
      [1, 0],
      [0, 1]
    ]
    
    id_mtrx(-2) ➞ [
      [0, 1],
      [1, 0]
    ]
    
    id_mtrx(0) ➞ []

### Notes

Incompatible types passed as `n` should return the string `"Error"`.

"""

def id_mtrx(n):
  if not isinstance(n, int):
    return "Error"
  elif n == 0:
    return []
  else:
    L = [[0]*abs(n) for x in range(abs(n))]
    for l in range(0, abs(n)):
      L[l][l] = 1
    if n < 0: L.reverse()
    return L
