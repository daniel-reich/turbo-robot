"""


Given a positive number x, if all the positive divisors of x (excluding x) add
up to x, then x is said to be a perfect number.

For example, the set of positive divisors of 6 excluding 6 itself is (1, 2,
3). The sum of this set is 6. Therefore, 6 is a _perfect_ number.

Given a positive number x, if all the positive divisors of x add up to a
second number y, and all the positive divisors of y add up to x, then x and y
are said to be a pair of _amicable_ numbers.

Create a function that takes a number and returns `"Perfect"` if the number is
perfect, `"Amicable"` if the number is part of an amicable pair, or
`"Neither"`.

### Examples

    num_type(6) ➞ "Perfect"
    
    num_type(2924) ➞ "Amicable"
    
    num_type(5010) ➞ "Neither"

### Notes

def num_type(n):
  pdiv = [i for i in range(1,n//2+1) if n % i == 0]
  spdiv = sum(pdiv)
  if spdiv == n: return "Perfect"
  if sum(i for i in range(1,spdiv//2+1) if spdiv % i == 0) == n: 
    return "Amicable"
  return "Neither"
