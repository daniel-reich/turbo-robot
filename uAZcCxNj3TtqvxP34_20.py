"""


The _mode_ of a group of numbers is the value (or values) that occur most
often (values have to occur more than once). Given a sorted list of numbers,
return a list of all modes in ascending order.

### Examples

    mode([4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 9, 10]) ➞ [6] 
    
    mode([4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]) ➞ [5, 8, 9]
    
    mode([1, 2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 7, 9]) ➞ [2, 6] 

### Notes

In this challenge, all group of numbers will have at least one mode.

"""

def mode(nums):
    d, result= {}, []
    for i in nums:
        d[i] = nums.count(i)
    for t in d.keys():
        if max(d.values()) == d[t]:
            result.append(t)
    return sorted(result)
