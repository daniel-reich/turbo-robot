"""


Given an amount of **money** and a list of **coins denominations** , create a
function that counts how many different ways you can make change with the
given money.

### Examples

    coins_combinations(4, [1, 2]) ➞ 3
    # 1+1+1+1 = 4
    # 1+1+2 = 4
    # 2+2 = 4
    
    coins_combinations(10, [5, 2, 3]) ➞ 4
    
    coins_combinations(11, [5, 7]) ➞ 0

### Notes

  * Order of coins does not matter (i.e. 1+1+2 == 2+1+1).
  * You have an infinite amount of coins.

def coins_combinations(amount, coins):
    dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for denom in coins:
        for a in range(denom, amount+1):
            dp[a] += dp[a-denom]                
    return dp[-1]
