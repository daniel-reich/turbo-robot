"""


Create a function that inverts words or the phrase depending on the value of
parameter `type`. A **"P"** means to invert the entire phrase, while a **"W"**
means to invert every word in the phrase. See the following examples for
clarity.

### Examples

    inverter("This is Valhalla", "P") ➞ "Valhalla is this"
    
    inverter("One fine day to start", "W") ➞ "Eno enif yad ot trats"
    
    inverter("Division by powers of two", "P") ➞ "Two of powers by division"

### Notes

  * The **first character** of the returned string should be in **uppercase** and the rest are in lowercase.
  * There will be no empty strings as inputs. Punctuation marks, though quite important for grammatical correctness, are discounted in the input phrases.

  r = ' '.join([t[0][::-1].capitalize()]+ [x.lower()[::-1] for x in t[1:]])
  return s if ty == "P" else r
