"""


Create a function that takes in a sentence and returns the average length of
each word in that sentence. Round your result to two decimal places.

### Examples

    average_word_length("A B C.") ➞ 1.00
    
    average_word_length("What a gorgeous day.") ➞ 4.00
    
    average_word_length("Dude, this is so awesome!") ➞ 3.80

### Notes

Ignore punctuation when counting the length of a word.

"""

def average_word_length(txt):
  S = txt.split()
  T = sum(len([letter for letter in i if letter.isalpha()]) for i in S)
  return round(T/len(S),2)
