"""


A courthouse has a backlog of several cases that need to be heard, and is
trying to set up an efficient schedule to clear this backlog. You will be
given the following inputs:

  * A dictionary `cases` whose values are the number of court sessions each case needs to be concluded.
  * An integer `max_daily_sessions` which gives the maximum number of court sessions that can be held each day.

Crucially, it is _**not possible** to have two sessions of the same case in
the same day_.

Write a function that _determines the **minimum number of days** needed to
clear the backlog_.

### Examples

    legalbacklog({"A":4, "B": 3, "C": 2}, 5) ➞ 4
    # There are three cases "A", "B", "C" needing 4, 3, 2 sessions, respectively. 
    # Moreover, up to five sessions can be held each day.
    # A possible schedule is:
    # day1 = ["A", "B", "C"], day2 = ["A", "B", "C"], day3 = ["A", "B"],
    # day4 = ["A"]
    
    legalbacklog({"A":4, "B": 3, "C": 2}, 3) ➞ 4
    # Same cases as above, but now with up to three sessions each day
    # Same schedule as above still words
    
    legalbacklog({"A":4, "B": 3, "C": 2}, 1) ➞ 9
    # Again same cases, but only one case per day,
    # hence answer is the number of cases, i.e. 9 
    
    legalbacklog({"A":4, "B": 3, "C": 2}, 2) ➞ 5
    # Same cases, but at most two sessions per day.
    # A possible schedule:
    # day1 = ["A", "B"], day2 = ["A", "B"], day3 = ["A", "B"],
    # day4 = ["A", "C"], day5 = ["C"]
    
    legalbacklog({"A":4, "B": 4, "C": 4}, 2) ➞ 6
    # Different case load, at most two sessions per day
    # A possible schedule:
    # day1 = ["A", "C"], day2 = ["A", "C"], day3 = ["A", "B"],
    # day4 = ["A", "B"], day5 = ["C", "B"], day6 = ["C", "B"]
