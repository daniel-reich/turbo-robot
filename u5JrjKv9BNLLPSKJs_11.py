"""


In the Recursive Staircase Problem, your task is to find the number of ways of
climbing a staircase of `n` stairs, with a set `s` possible steps. The example
below shows that if `n` was `2` and `s` was `{ 1, 2 }`, the answer would be
`2`:

           _
       _ |2  You could either go from step 0-2 (because the set s contains 2), or
    _ | 1    you could go from 0-1-2 (because the set s contains 1, taking one step at a time).
    0

More examples below.

### Examples

    num_ways(4, { 1, 2 }) ➞ 5
    
    num_ways(3, { 1, 2, 3 }) ➞ 4
    
    num_ways(10, { 1, 2, 3, 4 }) ➞ 401

### Notes

The more efficient your solution the better. Do not use unecessary recursion
as this will mean the program needs far longer to complete the tests.

def num_ways(n, s):
    g = [0]*(n+1)
    j=0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i-j>0:    
            g[i] += sum(g[i - j] for j in s)
        if i in s:
            g[i]+=1
    return g[-1]
