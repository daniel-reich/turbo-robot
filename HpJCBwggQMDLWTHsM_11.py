"""


Create a function that takes in a sentence and returns the average length of
each word in that sentence. Round your result to two decimal places.

### Examples

    average_word_length("A B C.") ➞ 1.00
    
    average_word_length("What a gorgeous day.") ➞ 4.00
    
    average_word_length("Dude, this is so awesome!") ➞ 3.80

### Notes

Ignore punctuation when counting the length of a word.

"""

def average_word_length(txt):
  sum_alpha = sum(i.isalpha() for i in txt)
  avg_word = round(sum_alpha / len(txt.split()), 2)
  return avg_word
