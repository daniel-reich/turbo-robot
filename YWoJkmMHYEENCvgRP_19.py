"""


You can assign variables from lists like this:

    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    first = lst[0]
    second = lst[1]
    third = lst[2]
    other = lst[3:]
    
    print(first) ➞ outputs 1
    print(second) ➞ outputs 2
    print(third) ➞ outputs 3
    print(other) ➞ outputs [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Create variables `first`, `second`, `third` and `other` from the given list
using **Destructuring Assignment** (check the **Resources** tab for some
examples).

### Examples

    first ➞ 1
    
    second ➞ 2
    
    third ➞ 3
    
    other ➞ [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Your task is to unpack the list `writeyourcodehere` into four variables,
`first`, `second`, `third`, and `other`.

### Notes

  * Your solution should be just **One Line** code.
  * If your solution is longer than one line of code, please check the **Resources** tab.
