"""


Create a function that counts the number of blocks of **two or more** adjacent
`1`s in a list.

### Examples

    count_ones([1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ 2
    # Two instances: [1, 1] (middle) and [1, 1, 1] (end)
    
    count_ones([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]) ➞ 0
    
    count_ones([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) ➞ 1
    
    count_ones([0, 0, 0]) ➞ 0

### Notes

  * A single 1 by itself (surrounded by a zero on its left and right), does **not** count towards the total (see first example).
  * Each input will contain only zeroes and ones.

def count_ones(lst):
  count=0
  consec=0
  for num in lst:
    if num==1:
      count+=1
    if num==0:
      if count>1: consec+=1
      count=0
  if count>1: consec+=1
  return consec
