"""


Each number in the _Perrin_ sequence is created by summing the numbers two
positions and three positions before it. The first three numbers are (3, 0,
2), and the sequence is extended as follows:

    P(0) P(1) P(2) P(3) P(4) P(5) P(6) P(7) ... P(n)
    3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, ...

Given a value for `n`, return the Perrin number P(n).

### Examples

    perrin(1) ➞ 0
    
    perrin(8) ➞ 10
    
    perrin(26) ➞ 1497

### Notes
