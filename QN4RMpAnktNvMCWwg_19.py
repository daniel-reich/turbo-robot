"""


An identity matrix is defined as a square matrix with **1s** running from the
top left of the square to the bottom right. The rest are **0s**. The identity
matrix has applications ranging from machine learning to the general theory of
relativity.

Create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the identity matrix of
`n x n` dimensions. For this challenge, if the integer is negative, return the
mirror image of the identity matrix of `n x n` dimensions.. It does not matter
if the mirror image is left-right or top-bottom.

### Examples

    id_mtrx(2) ➞ [
      [1, 0],
      [0, 1]
    ]
    
    id_mtrx(-2) ➞ [
      [0, 1],
      [1, 0]
    ]
    
    id_mtrx(0) ➞ []

### Notes

Incompatible types passed as `n` should return the string `"Error"`.

"""

import numpy as np
def id_mtrx(n):
  try:
    return((np.identity(abs(n)),np.rot90(np.identity(abs(n))))[n<0]).tolist()
  except:
    return "Error"
