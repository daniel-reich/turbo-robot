"""


You will be given a list of drinks, with each drink being a dictionary with
two properties: name and price. Create a function that has the `drinks` list
as an argument and return the drinks dictionaries sorted by price in ascending
order.

Assume that the following array of drink objects needs to be sorted:

    drinks = [
      {"name": "lemonade", "price": 50},
      {"name": "lime", "price": 10}
    ]

The output of the sorted drinks object will be:

### Examples

    sort_drinks_by_price(drinks) âžž [{name: "lime", price: 10}, {name: "lemonade", price: 50}]

### Notes

    return sorted(drinks, key=itemgetter('price'))
