"""


Write a function which, given a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., n-1]` ( `n>0`)
represented by a shuffled list, returns the permutation in _disjoint cycle
form_ as a set of tuples.

A **permutation** is a particular (re)ordering of a set of objects. For
example, `[1,3,0,4]` is a permutation on the 4 objects `[0,1,2,3]`. In this
problem, we represent permutations on `n` objects as lists containing the
numbers in `list(range(n)) == [0, ..., n-1]`.

A **cycle** or **cyclic permutation** is a particular kind of permutation
whereby all elements are sent to one another in a cyclic fashion. In this
problem, we represent cycles as tuples.

  * For example, the permutation `[1,2,3,0]` is a cyclic permutation of `[0,1,2,3]` because it can be made from `[0,1,2,3]` by applying the mapping `{0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:0}`, which maps elements in the _cycle_ `0➞1➞2➞3➞0`. We represent this cycle by the tuple `(0,1,2,3)`, where each element gets sent to the one on the right, and the last is sent to the first.
  * The cycles `(0,1,2,3)`, `(1,2,3,0)`, `(2,3,0,1)` and `(3,0,1,2)` all represent the same cycle; namely `0➞1➞2➞3➞0` . We always choose the cycle to have the lowest element first: `(0,1,2,3)`.

Finally, any permutation can be written in **disjoint cycle form** , or as an
unordered set of cyclic permutations. _Disjoint_ means none of the cycles have
any elements in common. This form is unique up to the order of the cycles and
up to the cycle representation.

  * The cyclic permutation `[0,1,3,2,4,5]` can be written as `(2,3)`—since 2 an 3 are swapped—and so the disjoint cycle form is `{(2,3)}`.
  * `[1,0,3,2]` is the mapping `{0:1, 1:0, 2:3, 3:2}` and has disjoint cycle form`{(0, 1), (2, 3)}` .

Your function takes a list (the permutation) and returns a set of tuples (the
set of cyclic permutations).

### Examples

    disjoint_cycle_form([1, 0]) ➞ {(0, 1)}
    # 0 and 1 are swapped, but lowest is listed first.
    
    disjoint_cycle_form([0, 1, 2, 3]) ➞ set()
    # Permutation is already in order.
    
    disjoint_cycle_form([0, 1, 3, 2]) ➞ {(2, 3)}
    
    disjoint_cycle_form([1, 0, 3, 2]) ➞ {(0, 1), (2, 3)}
    # or {(2, 3), (0, 1)}; the cycle order in a set doesn't matter.
    
    disjoint_cycle_form([1, 3, 0, 2]) ➞ {(0, 1, 3, 2)}

### Notes

Look up "disjoint cycle notation" or "cycle decomposition" for more
information about permutations. This is the kind of thing you learn in a first
course in Group Theory. Note that the given permutations will always have at
least one element (the only such permutation is `[0]`), and a permutation of
length `n` will always contain the elements of `range(n)` (that is, `0` to
`n-1` inclusive).
