"""


The bookstore from [this
collection](https://edabit.com/collection/dnXtkLPZpX25t227q) has increased
their security again. After setting the variable `res`, an if statement checks
if `res` is equal to the `users` dictionary. If it is, it sends an error.
Create a query that copies `users` to `res`.

### Examples

    param = "your text here"
    
    users = {
      "user1": "password",
      "user2": "password"
    }
    
    res = eval("search("%s")" % param)
    
    if res == users:
      res = {"Error": "No products found."}
    
    print(res) âžž users

### Notes

  * Create a string, not a function.
  * For readability, try to break your string into smaller substrings.
  * As an anti-cheat measure, naming a variable `x_x` is prohibited.
