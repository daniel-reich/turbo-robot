"""


Write a function that repeats the shorter string until it is equal to the
length of the longer string.

### Examples

    lengthen("abcdefg", "ab") ➞ "abababa"
    
    lengthen("ingenius", "forest") ➞ "forestfo"
    
    lengthen("clap", "skipping") ➞ "clapclap"

### Notes

  * Both strings will differ in length.
  * Both strings will contain at least one character.
  * Either of the two strings could be the shortest in length.

def lengthen(s1, s2):
    n = max(len(s1),len(s2))
    return ((s1 if len(s1) < len(s2) else s2)*n)[:n]
