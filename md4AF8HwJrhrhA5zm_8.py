"""


In colour theory, colour _harmony_ refers to an aesthetically pleasing
combination of colours. The standard colour wheel shows the 12 primary,
secondary and tertiary colours. Starting with _red_ , and moving clockwise,
the colours are:

    colours = ["red", "red-orange", "orange", "yellow-orange", "yellow", "yellow-green",  "green", "blue-green", "blue", "blue-violet", "violet", "red-violet"]

With an initial colour (called the **anchor** ), you can find combinations of
harmonious colours. The combination types are shown below, for an anchor
colour of _green_ :

Given an anchor colour and a combination type, write a function that returns a
_set_ containing all colours within the combination.

### Examples

    colour_harmony("green", "triadic") ➞ { "green", "violet", "orange" }
    
    colour_harmony("blue-green", "complementary") ➞ { "blue-green", "red-orange" }
    
    colour_harmony("orange", "analogous") ➞ { "yellow-orange", "red-orange", "orange" }

### Notes

  * Create the combinations given their relative positions from the anchor colour. For example, the rectangle combination starts with the colours two positions clockwise and four positions anti-clockwise from the anchor (and not the other way around). With the split-complemetary combination, you take the colours five positions both clockwise and anti-clockwise from the anchor. For the analogous combination, you include the colours directly on either side of the anchor.
  * Include the anchor colour in the final set.
