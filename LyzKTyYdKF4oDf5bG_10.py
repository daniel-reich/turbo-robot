"""


Write a **recursive** function that will return the longest word in a
sentence. In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.

### Examples

    find_longest("I will and ever will be gratefully and perpetually loving you Tesh!") ➞ "perpetually"
    
    find_longest("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") ➞ "forever"
    
    find_longest("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") ➞ "forgetfulness"
    
    find_longest("\"Strengths\" is the longest and most commonly used word that contains only a single vowel.") ➞ "strengths"

### Notes

  * Special characters and symbols _don't count_ as part of the word.
  * Return the longest word found in **lowercase** letters.
  * You are expected to solve this challenge via a **recursive** approach.
