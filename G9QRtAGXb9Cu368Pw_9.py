"""


Create a function that takes a variable number of arguments, each argument
representing the number of items in a group, and returns the number of
permutations (combinations) of items that you could get by taking one item
from each group.

### Examples

    combinations(2, 3) ➞ 6
    
    combinations(3, 7, 4) ➞ 84
    
    combinations(2, 3, 4, 5) ➞ 120

### Notes

  * Don't overthink this one.
  * Input may include the number zero.

def combinations(*items):
    answer = 1
    for i in items:
        if not i:
            continue
        answer *= i
    return answer
