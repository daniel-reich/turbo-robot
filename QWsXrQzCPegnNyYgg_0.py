"""


Create a function that takes numbers `b`, `m`, and `n` as arguments and
returns the definite integral of the function `f(x)=(b+1)*x^b` with respect to
`x` from `x=m` to `x=n`, where `b`, `m`, and `n` are constants.

### Examples

    integral(0, 2, 5) ➞ 3
    
    integral(2, 4, 7) ➞ 279
    
    integral(5, 9, 3) ➞ -530712

### Notes

  * `^` in the context of this challenge means "to the power of", also known as the "exponent" operator.
  * Assume that `b` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0.
  * `m` and `n` can be any integer, both positive and negative.

def integral(b, m, n):
    return pow(n, b + 1) - pow(m, b + 1)
