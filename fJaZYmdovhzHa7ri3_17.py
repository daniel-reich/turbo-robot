"""


The Collatz sequence is as follows:

  * Start with some given integer `n`.
  * If it is even, the next number will be `n` divided by 2.
  * If it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to make the next number.
  * The sequence stops when it reaches 1.

According to the Collatz conjecture, it will always reach 1. If that's true,
you can construct a finite sequence following the aforementioned method for
any given integer.

Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the **highest
integer** in the corresponding Collatz sequence.

### Examples

    max_collatz(10) ➞ 16
    # Collatz sequence: 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
    
    max_collatz(32) ➞ 32
    # Collatz sequence: 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
    
    max_collatz(85) ➞ 256
    # Collatz sequence: 85, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
