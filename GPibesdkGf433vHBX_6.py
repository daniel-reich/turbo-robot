[Goldbach's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture)
is amongst the oldest and well-known unsolved mathematical problems. In
correspondence with [Leonhard
Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) in 1742, German
mathematician [Christian
Goldbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Goldbach) made a conjecture,
which states:

 **"Every even whole number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers."**

Even though it's been thoroughly tested and analyzed and seems to be true, it
hasn't been proved yet (thus, remaining a conjecture.)

Create a function that takes a number and returns an array as per the
following rules:

  * If the given number is odd and greater than two, return an empty array.
  * If the given number is even and greater than two, return an array of two prime numbers whose sum is the given input.
  * Both prime numbers must be the farthest (with the greatest difference).

### Examples

    goldbach_conjecture(1) ➞ []
    # The given number is not greater than 2.
    
    goldbach_conjecture(7) ➞ []
    # The given number is not an even number.
    
    goldbach_conjecture(14) ➞ [3, 11]

### Notes

Return list in sequence: `[smaller, bigger]`
