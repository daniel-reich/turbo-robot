"""


Given a string `text`. Write a function that returns the character with the
highest frequency. If more than 1 character has the same highest frequency,
return all those characters as an array sorted in ascending order. If there is
no repetition in characters, return `"No Repetition"`.

### Examples

    max_occur("Computer Science") ➞ ['e']
    
    max_occur("Edabit") ➞ "No Repetition"
    
    max_occur("system admin") ➞ ['m', 's']
    
    max_occur("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") ➞ [' ']

### Notes

Try to make use of the concept used in counting sort.

"""

from collections import Counter
​
def max_occur(text):
  count = Counter(text).most_common()
  most = count[0][1]
  return [c[0] for c in count if c[1] == most] if most > 1 else 'No Repetition'
