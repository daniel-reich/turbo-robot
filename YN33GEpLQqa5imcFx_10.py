"""


The goal of this challenge is to return Pascal's triangle up to number 29.
Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two upper corners.

       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    
    # There will always be the 1 in the first
    # place and the row in the second.

Create a function that returns a row from Pascal's triangle. To find the row
and column you can use `n!/(k!*(n-k)!)` where `n` is the row down and `k` is
the column.

### Examples

    pascals_triangle(1) ➞ "1 1"
    
    pascals_triangle(4) ➞ "1 4 6 4 1"
    
    pascals_triangle(6) ➞ "1 6 15 20 15 6 1"
    
    pascals_triangle(8) ➞ "1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1"

### Notes

N/A

"""

import math
def pascals_triangle(row):
  res = []
  for k in range(0, row+1):
    a = math.factorial(row)//math.factorial(row-k)//math.factorial(k)
    res.append(str(a))
  return " ".join(res)
