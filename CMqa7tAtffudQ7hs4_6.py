"""


Given a shuffled list `l`, return a sequence of _transpositions_ which sorts
the list (as in `sorted(l)`). A transposition is a pair of indices `(i, j)`
representing that `l[i]` and `l[j]` be swapped. Specifically, the output is a
list of transpositions to be applied. Transpositions are applied as in:

    def apply_transpositions(l, swaps):
      for i, j in swaps:
      l[i], l[j] = l[j], l[i]
    return l

### Examples

    sorting_steps([5, -5]) ➞ [(0, 1)]
    # Swap first and second elements.
    
    sorting_steps([4, 3, 2, 1]) ➞ [(0, 3), (1, 2)] or even [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1)]
    
    sorting_steps([6, 6]) ➞ []

### Notes

Output is not unique! A given list may be sorted with varying numbers of
transpositions stemming from various sorting techniques. You need only produce
output which works. (This gives the problem algorithimic freedom!)
