"""


Write a function that receives a list of _x_ integers and returns a list of
_x_ integers in the Nth term of a quadratic number sequence (where _x_ is the
length of the incoming list). Your function should return the continuation of
the quadratic sequence of the length equal to the length of the given list.

### Examples

    quad_sequence([48, 65, 84]) ➞ [105, 128, 153]
    
    quad_sequence([0, 1, 6, 15, 28]) ➞ [45, 66, 91, 120, 153]
    
    quad_sequence([9, 20, 33, 48]) ➞ [65, 84, 105, 128]

### Notes

Both positive and negative numbers are included in the test cases.

def quad_sequence(lst):
  length = len(lst)
  n = (lst[2]-lst[1])-(lst[1]-lst[0])
  while len(lst)<length*2:
    diff = lst[-1]-lst[-2]
    diff+=n
    lst.append(lst[-1]+diff)
  return lst[len(lst)//2:]
