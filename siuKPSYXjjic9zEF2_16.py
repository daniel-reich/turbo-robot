"""


Aluminum foil has a thickness of **0.025mm**. A roll is formed by tightly
winding it around a tube with an outside diameter of 4cm. Given the length of
the foil in cm, write a function that returns the diameter of the roll in cm
measured at its thickest point. Round the result to four places.

### Examples

    foil(0) ➞ 4.0
    
    foil(50) ➞ 4.02
    
    foil(4321) ➞ 5.4575
    
    foil(10000) ➞ 6.9175
