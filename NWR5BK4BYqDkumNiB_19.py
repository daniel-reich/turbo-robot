"""


In this challenge, you have to verify if a number is exactly divisible by a
combination of its digits. There are three possible conditions to test:

  * The given number is exactly divisible by **each of its digits excluding the zeros**.
  * The given number is exactly divisible by the **sum of its digits**.
  * The given number is exactly divisible by the **product of its digits**.

Given an integer `n`, implement a function that returns:

  * If every test is true, a string `"Perfect"`.
  * If some test is true, the number of true tests (`1` or `2`).
  * If every test is false, a string `"Indivisible"`.

### Examples

    digital_division(21) ➞ 1
    # Exactly divisible only by the sum of its digits (2 + 1 = 3).
    
    digital_division(128) ➞ 2
    # Exactly divisible by each of its digits.
    # Exactly divisible by the product of its digits (1 * 2 * 8 = 16).
    
    digital_division(100) ➞ 2
    # Exactly divisible by each of its digits (excluding zeros).
    # Exactly divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 0 + 0 = 1).
    
    digital_division(12) ➞ "Perfect"
    # Exactly divisible by each of its digits.
    # Exactly divisible by 3 (sum of digits = 1 + 2).
    # Exactly divisible by 2 (product of digits = 1 * 2).
    
    digital_division(31) ➞ "Indivisible"
    # Every testing condition is false.

### Notes

  * Remember to exclude any 0-digit when testing if the given `n` is divisible by each of its digits (see example #3).
  * A number containing at least a 0-digit can't be exactly divided by the product of its digits (division by 0).
  * Trivially, every single-digit positive number greater than 0 is Perfect
  * Any given number will be a positive integer greater than 0.
