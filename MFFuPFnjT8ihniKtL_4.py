"""


When a bug jumps to a `height` _y_ , its position can be plotted as a
quadratic function with _x_ as the `time`, and _y_ as the vertical distance
traveled. For example, for a bug that jumps 9 cm up and is back on the ground
after 6 seconds, its trajectory can be plotted as:

Create a function that, given the max height of a vertical jump in cm and the
current time in milliseconds, returns the current position of the bug rounded
to two decimal places, and its direction (`"up"` or `"down"`). If the bug is
already back on the ground, return `0` for the position and `None` for the
direction.

### Examples

    bug_jump(9, 1000) ➞ [5, "up"]
    
    bug_jump(9, 4000) ➞ [8, "down"]
    
    bug_jump(9, 5500) ➞ [2.75, "down"]
    
    bug_jump(9, 7000) ➞ [0, None]

### Notes

  * Time and position both start at `0`.
  * You only need to translate the parabola (you don't need to scale it).

  y = -(time/1000 - sqrt(height))**2 + height
  
  half = sqrt(height)
  direction = 'down'
  if time/1000 <= half:
    direction = 'up'
    
  if y > 0:
    return [round(y, 2), direction]
  else:
    return [0, None]
