"""


Write a function that takes a string of source code and checks whether the
braces/parentheses are balanced. Every `(` or `{` must be closed by a `}` or
`)` in the opposite order. Return the index at which an imbalance occurs, or
`-1` if the string is balanced. If any `(` or `{` are never closed, return the
string's length.

### Examples

    check_balance("if (a(4) > 9) { foo(a(2)); }") ➞ -1
    # Returns -1 because it's balanced.
    
    check_balance("for (i=0;i<a(3};i++) { foo{); )") ➞ 14
    # Returns 14 because } is out of order.
    
    check_balance("if (x) {")  ➞ 8
    # Returns 8 because { is never closed.

### Notes

Think about how you can leverage [Stack Data
Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-python/).

def check_balance(expr):
    d = {']': '[', ')': '(', '}': '{'}
    stack = []
​
    for idx, i in enumerate(expr):
        if i in {'[', '(', '{'}:
            stack.append(i)
        elif i in d:
            if not stack or stack[-1] != d[i]:
                return idx
            stack.pop()
    return idx + 1 if stack else -1
