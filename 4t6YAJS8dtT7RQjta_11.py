"""


Create a function that returns the **thickness (in meters)** of a piece of
paper after folding it `n` number of times. The paper starts off with a
thickness of **0.5mm**.

### Examples

    num_layers(1) ➞ "0.001m"
    # Paper folded once is 1mm (equal to 0.001m)
    
    num_layers(4) ➞ "0.008m"
    # Paper folded 4 times is 8mm (equal to 0.008m)
    
    num_layers(21) ➞ "1048.576m"
    # Paper folded 21 times is 1048576mm (equal to 1048.576m)

### Notes

  * There are _1000mm_ in a _single meter_.
  * Don't round answers.
