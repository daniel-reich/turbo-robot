"""


In this challenge, you will learn about classes in python.

Python classes are easy to understand. They are almost the same as JavaScript
classes, with a different syntax and different constructor function names.
Constructors define some variables in your class; in Python that is `def
__init __(self)`. Other functions are defined the same as normal.

I want you to create a class called `programmer`. It should have a `salary`
value, `work_hours` value, and a `__del__(self)` function. `__del__(self)`
should return `"oof, " + str(salary) + ", " + str(work_hours)` when the object
is destroyed. `salary` and `work_hours` will be in the constructor. Variables
in a class are defined with `self.name = value`.

Also, define a function that will compare two programmers (their `salary` and
`work_hours`) and return the programmer with the lower salary. If their
`salary` is equal, then compare their `work_hours`, which will always be
different.

This is not really a challenge, just an introduction to Python classes.

### Examples

    prog = programmer(25000, 5)
    
    prog.salary ➞ 25000
    
    prog.work_hours ➞ 5
    
    del prog ➞ "oof, 25000, 5"
    # By the __ del __ function.

### Notes

  * Only base functions are pre-written in the code tab. You need to complete them and possibly add a few arguments.
  * Class variables are defined inside the `__init__` function.
  * In most cases `__del__` isn't used to return values (but it's not possible to check print output in an Edabit test).

class programer:
  def __init__ (self, sallary, work_hours):
    self.sallary = sallary
    self.work_hours = work_hours
    
  def __del__ (self):
    return "oof, {}, {}".format(self.sallary, self.work_hours)
  
  def compare (self, a):
    if self.sallary != a.sallary:
      return self if self.sallary < a.sallary else a
    else:
      return self if self.work_hours < a.work_hours else a
