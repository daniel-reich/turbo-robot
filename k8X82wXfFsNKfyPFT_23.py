"""


The **Code** tab has code which attempts to add a clone of a list to itself.
There is no error message, but the results are not as intended. Can you fix
the code?

### Examples

    clone([1, 1]) ➞ [1, 1, [1, 1]]
    
    clone([1, 2, 3]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]
    
    clone(["x", "y"]) ➞ ["x", "y", ["x", "y"]]

### Notes

def clone(lst):
    return lst + [lst]
