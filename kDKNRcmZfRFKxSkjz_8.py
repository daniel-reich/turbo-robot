"""


 _lPaeesh le pemu mnxit ehess rtnisg!_ Oh, sorry, that was supposed to say:
_Please help me unmix these strings!_

Somehow my strings have all become mixed up; every pair of characters has been
swapped. Help me undo this so I can understand my strings again.

### Examples

    unmix("123456") ➞ "214365"
    
    unmix("hTsii  s aimex dpus rtni.g") ➞ "This is a mixed up string."
    
    unmix("badce") ➞ "abcde"

### Notes

The length of a string can be odd — in this case the last character is not
altered (as there's nothing to swap it with).

def unmix(txt):
  t = ''.join(sum([[j,i] for i, j in zip(txt[::2],txt[1::2])],[]))
  if len(txt) % 2:
    t += txt[-1]
  return t
