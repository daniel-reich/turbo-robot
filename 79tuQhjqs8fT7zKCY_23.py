"""


Postfix notation is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their
operands. In other words, `pfexp1 pfexp2 op`, where `pfexp1` and `pfexp2` are
both postfix expressions.

Some examples:

  * `2 2 +` is the postfix notation of the expression `2 + 2`.
  * `2 3 * 1 - 5 /` is the postfix notation of the expression `((2 * 3) - 1) / 5`.

Here you have to compute the result from a postfix expression.

### Examples

    postfix("2 2 +") ➞ 4
    # 2 + 2 = 4
    
    postfix("2 3 * 1 - 5 /") ➞ 1
    # ((2 * 3) - 1) / 5 = (6 - 1) / 5 = 5 / 5 = 1

### Note

  * Operators and operands are separated by a space.
  * The operators `+, -, *, /` may be supported.
  * You can use Python list as a stack data structure to solve this problem.

    stack = []
    for a in expr.split():
        if a.isdigit():
            stack.append(int(a))
        else:
            x, y = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
            if a == '+':
                stack.append(y + x)
            elif a == '-':
                stack.append(y - x)
            elif a == '*':
                stack.append(y * x)
            elif a == '/':
                stack.append(y / x)
    return stack[0]
