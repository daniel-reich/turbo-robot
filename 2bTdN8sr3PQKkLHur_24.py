"""


You are given two numbers `a` and `b`. Create a function that returns the next
number greater than `a` and `b` and divisible by `b`.

### Examples

    divisible_by_b(17, 8) ➞ 24
    
    divisible_by_b(98, 3) ➞ 99
    
    divisible_by_b(14, 11) ➞ 22

### Notes

`a` will always be greater than `b`.

"""

def divisible_by_b(a, b):
    rem = (a + b) % b;  
    if (rem == 0):  
      return a
    else: 
      return (a + b - rem)
