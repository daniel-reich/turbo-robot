"""


You will be given a list of dancing couples, with the woman first and man
second, as well as a parameter `"men"` or `"women"`.

  * If the parameter is `"men"`, the men reverse their positions (first moves to last, last moves to first, etc), while women keep their positions.
  * If the parameter is `"women"`, the women reverse their positions, while men keep their positions.

      [Ana, Bob],

    ], men) ➞ [
