"""


Given a square matrix (i.e. same number of rows as columns), its _trace_ is
the sum of the entries in the main diagonal (i.e. the diagonal line from the
top left to the bottom right).

As an example, for:

    [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ]

... the trace is 1 + 5 + 9 = 15.

Write a function that takes a square matrix and computes its trace.

### Examples

    trace([
      [1, 4],
      [4, 1]
    ]) ➞ 2
    
    # 1 + 1 = 2
    
    trace([
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ]) ➞ 15
    
    # 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
    
    trace([
      [1, 0, 1, 0],
      [0, 2, 0, 2],
      [3, 0, 3, 0],
      [0, 4, 0, 4]
    ]) ➞ 10
    
    # 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

### Notes

As in the examples, the size of the matrices will vary (but they will always
be square).

"""

def trace(lst):
    sum = 0
    count = 0
    for el in lst:
        sum = sum + el[count]
        count = count + 1
    return sum
