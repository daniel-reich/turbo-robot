Create a function that takes a list of students and returns an dictionary
representing their notes distribution. Have in mind that all invalid notes
should not be count in the distribution. Valid notes are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

### Example

    get_notes_distribution([
      {
        "name": "Steve",
        "notes": [5, 5, 3, -1, 6]
      },
      {
        "name": "John",
        "notes": [3, 2, 5, 0, -3]
      }
    ] âžž {
      5: 3,
      3: 2,
      2: 1
    })
