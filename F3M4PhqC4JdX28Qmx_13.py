 **Mubashir** has started his journey from home. Given a string of
`directions` (N=North, W=West, S=South, E=East), he will walk for one minute
in each direction. Determine whether a set of directions will lead him back to
the starting position or not.

### Examples

    back_to_home("NENESSWW") ➞ True
    
    back_to_home("NEESSW") ➞ False

    s = directions.count('S')
    w = directions.count('W')
    
    if n == s and e == w:
        return True
    return False
