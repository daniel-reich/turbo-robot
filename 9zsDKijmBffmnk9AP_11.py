"""


You hired three programmers and you (hopefully) pay them. Create a function
that takes three numbers (the hourly wages of each programmer) and returns the
difference between the highest-paid programmer and the lowest-paid.

## Examples

    programmers(147, 33, 526) ➞ 493
    
    programmers(33, 72, 74) ➞ 41
    
    programmers(1, 5, 9) ➞ 8

## Notes

  * Don't forget to `return` the result.
  * If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the **Resources** tab.
  * If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the **Solutions** tab.
