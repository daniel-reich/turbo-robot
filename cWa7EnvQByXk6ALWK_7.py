"""


The golden ratio is ubiquitous in math, science, art, and nature. This
challenge is concerned with the number itself, which is 1.618033988 to 10
significant digits. Implement a function that calculates the golden ratio to
100 significant digits using only integers, strings and basic arithmetic
operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `//`

### Examples

    golden_ratio() âžž 1.618033988+90 more decimal places

### Notes

This function has no argument so naturally there is only one test case.

"""

def golden_ratio():
  a,b=1,0
  for i in range(238): a,b=a+b,a
  return '1.'+str(int('1'+'0'*99)*b//a)
