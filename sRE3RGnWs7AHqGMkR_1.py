"""


Write five **regular expressions:**

  * One called `integers` that will match **all whole numbers** , positive or negative.
  * One called `floats` that will match **all decimal numbers** , positive or negative.
  * One called `positive` that will match **all positive numbers** , whole or decimal.
  * One called `negative` that will match **all negative numbers** , whole or decimal.
  * One called `numbers` that will match **all numbers** , whole or decimal, positive or negative.

Details to take into account:

  * Fractions of 1 may or may not be preceded by a 0. All `0.5`, `.5`, `-.5` and are valid numbers.
  * Floats will have at least one decimal number. Both `4.` and `-3.` are not valid numbers.
  * Positives numbers may or may not be preceded by a `+`. Both `3` and `+3` are valid numbers.
  * Numbers preceded by more than one symbol or having more than one decimal point are no considered valid. All `++1`, `-+4`, `3.3.6` are not valid numbers.
  *  **All numbers, valid or not, will be preceded and followed by a whitespace.**

###  Example

    txt = " 123.456 2 +7 -88 -.25 9.10.11 -4. +-34 -0.6 --5 "
    integers = "yourregularexpressionhere"
    floats = "yourregularexpressionhere"
    positive = "yourregularexpressionhere"
    negative = "yourregularexpressionhere"
    numbers = "yourregularexpressionhere"
    
    re.findall(integers, txt) ➞ ["2", "+7", "-88"]
    re.findall(floats, txt) ➞ ["123.456", "-.25", "-0.6"]
    re.findall(positive, txt) ➞ ["123.456", "2", "+7"]
    re.findall(negative, txt) ➞ ["-88", "-.25", "-0.6"]
    re.findall(numbers, txt) ➞ ["123.456", "2", "+7", "-88", "-.25", "-0.6"]

### Notes

  * You **don't** need to write a function, just the pattern.
  * Do **not** remove `import re` from the code.
  * If you get stuck, check **Comments** for some helpful hints.
  * Find more info on RegEx in **Resources**.
  * You can find all the challenges of this series in my [Basic RegEx](https://edabit.com/collection/8PEq2azWDtAZWPFe2) collection.
