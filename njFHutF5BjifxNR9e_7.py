"""


Your friend is trying to write a function to accomplish the following
transformations:

    x = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
    
    // Each time x is called, the following results are shown:
    
    change(x, 0)  // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
    change(x, 1)  // [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]
    change(x, 2)  // [3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
    change(x, 3)  // [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3]

Note: **The`change()` function should not mutate the original list**. After
each call to the function, the original `x` should still equal `[3, 3, 3, 3,
3, 3, 3]`.

She comes up with the following code:

    def change(x, times):
      for i in range(len(x)):
        j = 1
        while j <= times:
          if i >= j and i < len(x)-j:
            x[i] -= 1
          j += 1
      return x

Oops! The code appears to **mutate** the original list. Fix this incorrect
code so that the function **no longer mutates the original list**.

See below:

### Examples

    x = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
    
    // What we want:
    change(x, 2) => [3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
    
    change(x, 2) => [3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
    
    // What we get:
    change(x, 2) => [3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]  // Good so far...
    
    change(x, 2) => [3, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 3] // List is mutated :(

### Notes

  * If this is confusing, copy and paste the incorrect code in a REPL environment and play around with the code to understand what the function is doing.
  * Hint: Try to make a copy of the input list.
  * If this looks familiar, it is part of a solution for the **Concentric Rug** problem.
