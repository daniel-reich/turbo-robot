"""


You can assign variables from lists like this:

    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    first = lst[0]
    middle = lst[1:-1]
    last = lst[-1]
    
    print(first) ➞ outputs 1
    print(middle) ➞ outputs [2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(last) ➞ outputs 6

With Python 3, you can assign variables from lists in a much more succinct
way. Create variables `first`, `middle` and `last` from the given list using
**destructuring assignment** (check the **Resources** tab for some examples),
where:

    first  ➞ 1
    
    middle ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    last ➞ 6

Your task is to unpack the list `writeyourcodehere` into three variables,
being `first`, `middle`, and `last`, with `middle` being everything in between
the first and last element. Then print all three variables.

### Notes

  * Your solution should be just **one line** of code.
  * If your solution is longer than one line of code, please review the **Resources** tab.
